Format: `Version — Date — Summary`

## v0.6.0 — 2026-04-10 — Phase 6: Grid Placement

### Added
- **`docs/js/ui/placement.js`** — Full placement module:
  - Module-scoped selection state (`_selection`)
  - Click deck card → select for placement (highlight)
  - Click same deck card / press Escape / leave shop → deselect
  - Click empty grid tile while selected → place card, clear selection
  - Click placed grid card → opens a modal with:
    - Full stats + description
    - Targeting buttons (🎯 First / 💪 Strongest / 🩸 Weakest) — only for damage-dealing plants
    - Remove button (returns card to deck inventory)
    - Close button
  - **Sunflower → Gilded Rose auto-merge** when a 3rd Sunflower is placed. Removes all 3 sunflower instances, creates a fresh Gilded Rose instance at the anchor tile, plays `go` SFX + success toast.
  - Sell-pill button added to each deck card (separate from the main click-to-select handler).
- **Grid rendering upgrades** (`docs/js/game/grid.js` via placement module):
  - Placed cards are painted as small icons on their tiles
  - Valid-placement tiles get a dashed gold outline when in selection mode
  - Tile click callback delegates to placement logic
- **`renderGridCardIcon(card)`** helper in `cardView.js` — compact icon for in-tile rendering.
- **Deck inventory** now shows **only unplaced cards**. Placed cards are visible on their grid tiles instead. An empty deck shows a friendly "all cards placed" hint.
- **Escape key handler** on the SHOP state clears placement selection without leaving the screen.
- **SHOP.exit** lifecycle hook clears placement selection when leaving the shop (prevents stale selection on re-entry).

### Fixed (Phase 5 audit follow-ups)
- **Bug 1:** `startNewRun` now deep-copies `DEFAULT_RUN` so all schema fields (shopRoll, shopRollRound, aetherSpells, packsOpened) are initialized on fresh runs. Previously only Phase 3 fields were set; Phase 5 fields existed only by defensive init.
- **Bug 2:** `buyPack` no longer pre-flight-blocks when deck is full. Aether-Root spells routed to their own inventory always get saved. Regular cards that would overflow are dropped with a warning toast so the player knows to sell first.
- **Dead code:** Removed unused `added` tracker variable in `buyPack`.

### Changed
- `renderCard` gains `isSelected`, `isPlaced`, `onSell` options.
- `shop.renderShop()` no longer renders the deck inventory (moved to `placement.renderPlacement()`).
- Phase badge advances to "Phase 6 — Placement". Version bumped to v0.6.0.

### Notes
- Sunflower merge picks the most recently placed Sunflower as the anchor (where the Gilded Rose appears). The other two Sunflower tiles become empty.
- Drag-and-drop placement was deferred — click-to-place covers both mobile and desktop cleanly.
- Targeting is only editable via the placed-card modal (per-card, post-placement). The spec suggested pre-placement targeting; this approach feels more natural and matches card-game patterns.

---

## v0.5.0 — 2026-04-10 — Phase 5: Shop Mode

### Added
- **Full shop UI** with three rarity-colored card slots, refresh button (1 gold), pack chests, and deck inventory.
- **`docs/js/ui/cardView.js`** — Reusable card renderer used by shop slots, deck inventory, and pack reveals. Renders rarity stripe, name, type, stats, description, and footer (cost or sell value).
- **`docs/js/ui/shop.js`** — Full shop logic module:
  - `rerollShop`, `refreshShop`, `ensureShopRollForRound` — shop roll lifecycle
  - `buyShopSlot` — gold check, deck-cap check, atomic buy
  - `sellDeckCard` — confirms via modal, refunds gold
  - `buyPack` — pity-aware pack opening, distributes regular cards to deck and Aether-Root spells to side panel inventory
  - `renderShop` — full UI repaint
- **Pack chests** with rarity-tinted backgrounds. Frenzy chest shimmers. Each chest shows current pity status ("Pity in N").
- **Pack reveal modal** — staggered fade-in of revealed cards with rarity-colored borders. Legendary cards glow gold.
- **Deck inventory** — compact card view, tap to sell with confirmation. Shows current count "X / 10".
- **Free auto-reroll** at the start of each new round (tracked via `shopRollRound`). The paid Refresh button still works mid-round.
- **Card-instance system** — Each owned card has a unique `instanceId` and a deterministic `sellValue` rolled at acquisition (no save-scumming).
- **Aether-Root spell side inventory** (`run.aetherSpells`) — Aether-Root spells from packs go here instead of the regular deck. Phase 9 wires the side panel.
- **`bodyHtml` + `wide` options on showModal** — supports the rich pack reveal layout.
- **CSS** — `.card.*` rarity tinting, `.pack-chest-*` chest variants, `.deck-inventory` grid, `.reveal-grid` modal layout, `.screen-scrollable` for the now-vertical shop screen.

### Fixed (Phase 4 audit follow-ups)
- **Validator scope:** Now also enforces a valid `pack` field for `economy` category cards (Crystal Fern, Amber Grain, Midas Mandrake) when they ship in packs.
- **Validator coverage:** "missing rarity in pack" warning now considers AETHER_ROOT_SPELLS as part of the pack pool, preventing false positives for packs that rely on side-panel spells for some rarity tier.

### Changed
- `currentRun` schema additions: `shopRoll`, `shopRollRound`, `aetherSpells`, `packsOpened` (already existed but now actually used).
- Shop screen is now `screen-scrollable` (allows vertical content beyond viewport).
- Phase badge advances to "Phase 5 — Shop Mode".
- Version label bumped to v0.5.0.

### Notes
- Pack reveal animation is currently a modal. Phase 12 may upgrade it to a full-screen chest-opening sequence.
- Deck cards are not yet placeable on the grid — that's Phase 6.
- Sunflower auto-merge into Gilded Rose is also Phase 6 (placement-time logic).

---

## v0.4.0 — 2026-04-10 — Phase 4: Card Data Model

### Added
- **39 cards** defined as data, ready for the Phase 5 shop to consume:
  - **14 standard cards**: 6 plants (Seedling Scrubber → Solar Archon), 6 spells (Barkskin Guard → Solar Flare), 2 standard economy plants (Sunflower, Gilded Rose)
  - **19 pack-exclusive cards**: 6 Mythic, 7 Arcane, 6 Frenzy — including pack-tier economy plants (Amber Grain, Crystal Fern, Midas Mandrake)
  - **6 Aether-Root spells**: Sap-Mend, Grove-Shield, Thorn-Pulse, Photosynthetic Burst, Nature's Wrath, Verdant Rebirth
- **`docs/js/cards/rarities.js`** — 6 rarity tiers with colors, drop weights, cost/sell ranges
- **`docs/js/cards/packs.js`** — 3 pack tiers with cost, card count, drop weights, pity rules
- **`docs/js/cards/standard.js`** — Standard shop pool (14 cards)
- **`docs/js/cards/packExclusives.js`** — All Mythic/Arcane/Frenzy cards (19 cards)
- **`docs/js/cards/aetherRoot.js`** — 6 player-active side-panel spells
- **`docs/js/cards/validate.js`** — Sanity-checks at boot (duplicate IDs, missing fields, invalid rarity/category, pack weight sums, missing legendaries for pity)
- **`docs/js/cards/index.js`** — Public API:
  - Query: `getCard(id)`, `getCardsByRarity(r)`, `getCardsByCategory(c)`, `getCardsByPack(p)`, `getShopEligibleCards()`, `getAetherRootSpells()`
  - Random: `rollShopCard()`, `rollShopCards(n)`, `rollPackCards(packId, pityState)`, `rollCost(card)`, `rollSell(card)`
  - Format: `formatCardStats(card)`, `formatCardLabel(card)`
  - Pity: Frenzy pack guarantees one Epic+; every 5th Frenzy guarantees a Legendary

### Validated
- 1000 sample shop rolls match configured rarity weights within ~1.5%
- Frenzy pack pity reliably drops a Legendary on the 5th open
- Every Frenzy pack contains at least one Epic+ card
- All 39 cards have unique IDs, valid rarities, and complete required fields

### Changed
- Phase badge advances to "Phase 4 — Card Data"
- Version label bumped to v0.4.0
- `window.__pvz` debug object now exposes the entire `Cards` namespace

### Notes
- Pack-exclusive cards have `cost: null` since they're never directly purchasable from the regular shop
- Aether-Root spells use `cooldown` (or `oncePerRound`) instead of cost since they're cast for free during combat
- Card abilities are stored as semi-structured descriptors (e.g., `{ type: 'slow_on_hit', percent: 0.5, duration: 2.0 }`) for the Phase 7 combat engine to interpret

---

## v0.3.0 — 2026-04-10 — Phase 3: Round Flow & Game Over

### Added
- **Round summary screen** — gold earned, kills, plants lost, current HP, total gold. Wired to `currentRun.lastRoundStats`. The combat engine in Phase 7 will populate the values.
- **Game-over flow** — `damageAetherRoot()` decrements HP and transitions to `GAME_OVER` at 0. Game-over screen shows total kills, gold earned, plants lost, difficulty, and round reached.
- **Debug "Take 10 Damage" button** on the combat screen — lets you exercise the game-over flow before real combat lands.
- **HUD format upgrade** — round counter shows "Round X / 10" for standard modes and just "Round X" for Endless. HP shows "current / max".
- **HP color coding** — `.hud-hp-low` (red) below 25%, `.hud-hp-med` (amber) below 50%.
- **Difficulty card enrichment** — each card now shows enemy HP/DMG multipliers as subtext (e.g., "Enemy: 200% HP · 150% DMG" on Hard).
- **Round 10 victory stub** — clicking "Victory!" on the round-end summary unlocks Endless mode (saves to meta), shows toast, returns to menu. Phase 8 will add a proper victory screen.
- **New SFX** — `damage` (low sawtooth sweep, alarming) and `gameover` (descending lament).
- **Per-round stat accumulators** on `currentRun` — `lastRoundGoldEarned`, `lastRoundKills`, `lastRoundPlantsLost` ready for Phase 7 combat to populate.
- **Run-total tracking** — `totalKills`, `totalGoldEarned`, `totalPlantsLost` persisted across rounds.

### Changed
- `endRound()` is now a real function: snapshots per-round stats into `lastRoundStats`, accumulates run totals, increments round counter, transitions to ROUND_END.
- `GAME_OVER` no longer immediately clears `currentRun` — it's kept in memory so the game-over screen can read its stats. Cleared on back-to-menu.
- Phase badge advances to "Phase 3 — Round Flow".
- Version label bumped to v0.3.0.

### Fixed (Phase 2 audit follow-ups)
- **Bug 1:** Volume scaling was quadratic. The SFX bus AND each preset both multiplied by `sfxVolume`, so 50% slider gave ~6% sound. Presets now use fixed inner gains; the bus is the only volume scaler. Slider response is now linear.
- **Bug 2:** Volume slider couldn't reach 0. `Number(value) || 60` treated 0 as falsy and silently substituted 60. Replaced with explicit `value !== undefined ? Number(value) : 60`.
- **Bug 3:** Pause button overlapped the phase badge. Phase badge moved from `top-right` to `top-left`; pause button kept at top-right of game header.

---

## v0.2.0 — 2026-04-10 — Phase 2: Main Menu & Settings

### Added
- **AudioManager** (`docs/js/game/audio.js`) — Web Audio API wrapper with lazy init (autoplay-policy compliant). Synthesizes 5 SFX presets: `click`, `hover`, `tick`, `go`, `back`. Music stub ready for Phase 12 tracks.
- **Modal system** (`docs/js/ui/modal.js`) — Promise-based modal with backdrop blur, Escape/click-out dismissal, configurable buttons. Replaces native `window.confirm`.
- **Animated title screen** — Gradient shimmer (`titleShimmer`) + gentle vertical bob (`titleBob`).
- **Pulsing Start Game button** — Concentric ring pulse animation drawing the eye.
- **Volume sliders** — Music + SFX, live `input` event updates AudioManager and persists immediately.
- **Resume Game button** — Visible on menu when `Save.hasRun()` returns true; restores `currentRun` and jumps to SHOP.
- **In-game pause button** (⚙) — Top-right of shop/combat screens, opens Settings as a pause menu.
- **Quit Run button** — Visible only in Settings when a run is in progress; confirms before clearing the run.
- **Settings back button** — Returns to wherever Settings was opened from (uses `state.previous`), so opening Settings mid-run resumes back into the run.
- **Audio feedback** — All button clicks play `click` SFX, back actions play `back`, countdown ticks play `tick`, round-start plays `go`.

### Changed
- Reset Game now uses the new modal system instead of native `confirm()`.
- Phase badge in header advances to "Phase 2 — Menu & Settings".
- `applySettings` now also reads volume sliders and pushes settings into AudioManager.
- Version label bumped to v0.2.0.

### Fixed (Phase 1 audit follow-ups)
- All 6 audit issues fixed in v0.1.1: countdown timing, screen fade-in, endless lock leak, grid checker pattern, animation reset, hardcoded difficulty labels.

### Notes
- Music tracks themselves are still deferred to Phase 12; the music toggle/volume affect future playback.
- The pause button is visible but the round simulation isn't yet pausable (no combat sim exists). Treats Settings overlay as a logical pause.
- Audio context initializes on first user click (browser autoplay policy).

---

## v0.1.1 — 2026-04-10 — Phase 1 Audit Fixes

### Fixed
- **Bug 1:** Countdown is now exactly 5 seconds (5,4,3,2,1 → combat) instead of 6.
- **Bug 2:** Screen fade-in animation re-runs on every screen swap via `.is-active` class + reflow.
- **Bug 3:** Endless unlock state no longer leaks after game reset; difficulty cards rebuilt from `DIFFICULTIES` + meta on every enter.
- **Bug 5:** Grid checker pattern fixed — uses `(row+col)%2` parity classes (`.tile-a`/`.tile-b`) instead of `:nth-child(even)` which produced vertical stripes.
- **Bug 6:** Countdown animation reset now uses class swap (`.ticking`) instead of mutating inline `animation` property.
- **Issue 1:** Difficulty card labels now built from `DIFFICULTIES` in JS (single source of truth); removed hardcoded HP/Gold strings from `index.html`.
- **Bonus:** `startNewRun` now re-checks meta for endless unlock; previously it always rejected based on the static `locked` flag.

---

## v0.1.0 — 2026-04-10 — Phase 1: Core Engine

### Added
- **State machine** (`docs/js/game/state.js`) — `MENU → DIFFICULTY → SHOP → COUNTDOWN → COMBAT → ROUND_END → GAME_OVER` with `enter`/`exit`/`update`/`render` lifecycle hooks
- **Game loop** (`docs/js/game/loop.js`) — `requestAnimationFrame` driver with delta-time clamping
- **Save system** (`docs/js/game/save.js`) — localStorage persistence for `pvz:settings`, `pvz:run`, `pvz:meta` with safe parse/write fallbacks
- **5×12 grid** (`docs/js/game/grid.js`) — model + DOM renderer with Aether-Root anchor
- **Difficulty config** (`docs/js/game/difficulty.js`) — Tutorial/Easy/Normal/Hard/Insane/Endless stat sources
- **Screen manager** (`docs/js/ui/screens.js`) — section toggle by `data-screen`
- **Bootstrap** (`docs/js/main.js`) — wires DOM events, settings sync, HUD updates, run lifecycle
- **Real `index.html`** — replaces placeholder; contains all 8 screens (menu, difficulty, shop, countdown, combat, round_end, game_over, settings)
- **`docs/css/main.css`** — reset, dark + light theme variables, full layout for all Phase 1 screens, animated countdown, responsive breakpoint

### Changed
- Phase badge in header now reads "Phase 1 — Core Engine"
- `Phases.md` Phase 1 marked complete; current phase advanced to Phase 2

### Notes
- Combat is not yet implemented — the "End Round (debug)" button manually advances state
- Card data, shop logic, and combat engine arrive in Phases 4–7
- Use `window.__pvz` in browser dev console to inspect state/save
